Welcome to the ASCII Explorer’s Guide!

Control Characters:
ASCII has invisible heroes like Null (\0), Start of Heading (\1), End of Text (\3), and Bell (\7). These symbols control devices rather than display text. For example, Bell (\7) makes a sound, signaling an event. Others, like Line Feed (\n) and Carriage Return (\r), help with text formatting. Tab (\t) also keeps text organized, moving the cursor to the next tab stop.

Printable Characters:
Now onto visible stars! Numbers: 0123456789 are universal for counting. Uppercase Letters (A-Z) and Lowercase Letters (a-z) form words. Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.) are often used in coding, emails, and expressions.

Extended ASCII:
Symbols in Extended ASCII (128-255) add accents for languages, math symbols, and more. Examples include "é" (\233), "ç" (\231), and the iconic "©" (\169). These enrich our text for global communication and professional fields.

In ASCII, each character from 0 to 255 has a role, making our text world more dynamic and organized. Whether it’s displaying letters, numbers, symbols, or even directing how text behaves, ASCII is foundational to digital communication.
